# Ven's Theme

This is my own self-made BetterDiscord theme. You can easily customize the colours!

## Download

- Install the [Theme Repo Plugin](https://betterdiscord.net/ghdl?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/master/Plugins/ThemeRepo/ThemeRepo.plugin.js). This will keep your theme updated
- Enable it, go into its settings > Custom Themes and paste one of the following links in:
  - [Green](https://mattis6666.github.io/BetterDiscord-Themes/VensGreen.theme.css)
  - [Purple](https://mattis6666.github.io/BetterDiscord-Themes/VensPurple.theme.css)
- Refetch all > Reload
- Go into your Themes Settings > Theme Repo > Search for "Ven's"
- Download and enable it. Check back regularly for updates!

## Changing the Colours

- Simple solution:
  - Install the [Theme Settings Plugin](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ThemeSettings)
  - Enable it
  - Now there will be a settings button next to my theme allowing you to change the colours with a colour wheel
- Manual Solution:

  - Open the file with your favourite text editor
  - Find the root at the top of the file and change the main and accent rgb colours. Make sure to use proper syntax and valid RGB colours!
